        <p style="text-indent: 100px; text-align: left;">All born and raised in Vail, Colorado, The Stage Frights’ four members have been together since their first footsteps. Elizabeth, The Stage Frights’ lead singer and one of two electric guitarists, started the band in 2010 when she put posters around her high school asking for people to join her and her love for music! Since their very first public concert in August of 2011, they have done what they love to do and have shared outstanding music with all of their fans!</p>
